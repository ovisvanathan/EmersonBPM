# EmersonBPM

A BPM engine written in Java using RxJava reactive extensions. Can run DRL rules as well as native rules written in DSL. 

Formerly called Monarch, the project has been refactored to be more modular with code being  better organized into

relevant modules. Features a new Expression Resolver based evaluator. The former SQL evaluator and DSL has been retained

as well. 

The RxJava extensions are not fully ready yet as it is a work in progress. So you can expect some glitches. Been thinking we need 

a more standard way of messaging maybe even propertychangelisteners will do. Also written my own messaging library based on Minibus.

That should do as well. 

Action/Events part is also work in progress. A new concept called Relations, useful to make inferences is also under construction

I could do with some extra help. Ping me on ovisvanathan@gmail.com if you are interested.
